# Black_friday

This is the test task of landing page for promo action **Black Friday**.

Landing page is responsive and adaptive to 320px.

I've used bootstrap 12 grid system, HTML5, CSS3, Sass there.

You can stop countdown timer to change the date in property `let tl` in [js/contdown.js](https://github.com/basystka/Black_friday/blob/master/js/countdown.js) 

`let tl = new Date('2020/11/30 00:00:00');`

If you change the date for example to 2019, you'll see the message **Black Friday Promo is Over**
